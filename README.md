# dg-welding-wp

This is a website built for DG Welding & Mfg.

Using:
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for a CMS
- [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) WordPress theme
  - because it's minimal
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) WordPress plugin
  - so I can build custom PHP templates and client can edit content within
- [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) for dev
  - because build systems are nice
